Hey! Welcome to codebase behind my portfolio site. Seeing you here must mean you like my portfolio and are interested in the tech behind it.
Well, thank you! I'm proud to show you my processes, failures and successes in their full glory. Let's dive right in.

## The Idea

I've had this idea about moving and morphing stars into various zodiac-esque objects in the background of a website for a while now.
I've been interested in ThreeJS for a while now, but i didn't know *where* to implement this. 
When I was *at long last* thinking about creating my own portfolio website, the idea struck me to finally integrate the starry night (pun intended) into a work of mine.

I had a rough idea about how I wanted to implement it: 
- The background should be just the stars that make up the object.
- When scrolling, the stars should morph into another object as the page section changes.

Not knowing how exactly I should implement it and not quite satisfied with the idea, I turned to my buddy ChatGPT.
Because of my shitty descriptions, almighty ChatGPT misunderstood my intentions and started talking about a whole nightsky of zodiac objects that clickable.
This misunderstanding was the birth of the universe (navbar).

Suddenly it clicked and I could see the whole thing before me. A super cool whole page navbar of clickable zodiac signs. 
A sick 'flying through space' type animation on click and the zodiac object being rebuilt when finished navigating.

The rest is just coming up with everything I want to be on the website.

At least thats what I think (and hope) it will turn out like. 
I wrote this whole paragraph before even writing a single line of code.
